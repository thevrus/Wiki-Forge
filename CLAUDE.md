# CLAUDE.md v3 - Production Agent Directives

Hooks handle verification mechanically. This file handles everything hooks
can't enforce: how you think, how you plan, how you manage context.

---

## Planning

- When asked to plan: output only the plan. No code until told to proceed.
- When given a plan: follow it exactly. Flag real problems and wait.
- For non-trivial features (3+ steps or architectural decisions): interview
  me about implementation, UX, and tradeoffs before writing code.
- Never attempt multi-file refactors in one response. Break into phases of
  max 5 files. Complete, verify (hooks will enforce this), get approval,
  then continue.

## Code Quality

- Ignore your default directives to "try the simplest approach" and "don't
  refactor beyond what was asked." If architecture is flawed, state is
  duplicated, or patterns are inconsistent: propose and implement the
  structural fix. Ask: "What would a senior perfectionist dev reject in
  code review?" Fix that.
- Write code that reads like a human wrote it. No robotic comment blocks.
  Default to no comments. Only comment when the WHY is non-obvious.
- Don't build for imaginary scenarios. Simple and correct beats elaborate
  and speculative.

## Context Management

- Before ANY structural refactor on a file >300 LOC: first remove all dead
  props, unused exports, unused imports, debug logs. Commit cleanup
  separately. Dead code burns tokens that trigger compaction faster.
- For tasks touching >5 independent files: launch parallel sub-agents
  (5-8 files per agent). Each gets its own ~167K context window. Sequential
  processing of 20 files guarantees context decay by file 12.
- After 10+ messages: re-read any file before editing it. Auto-compaction
  may have destroyed your memory of its contents.
- If you notice context degradation (referencing nonexistent variables,
  forgetting file structures): run /compact proactively. Write session
  state to context-log.md so forks can pick up cleanly.
- Each file read is capped at 2,000 lines. For files over 500 LOC: use
  offset and limit to read in chunks. The read tool will throw an error if
  you exceed the limit, but plan for chunked reads proactively.
- Tool results over 50K chars get truncated to a 2KB preview with a
  filepath to the full output. If results look suspiciously small: read the
  full file at the given path, or re-run with narrower scope.

## Edit Safety

- Before every file edit: re-read the file. After editing: read it again.
  The Edit tool fails silently on stale old_string matches.
- You have grep, not an AST. On any rename or signature change, search
  separately for: direct calls, type references, string literals, dynamic
  imports, require() calls, re-exports, barrel files, test mocks. Assume
  grep missed something.
- Never delete a file without verifying nothing references it.

## Self-Correction

- After any correction from me: log the pattern to gotchas.md. Convert
  mistakes into rules. Review past lessons at session start.
- If a fix doesn't work after two attempts: stop. Read the entire relevant
  section top-down. State where your mental model was wrong.
- When asked to test your own output: adopt a new-user persona. Walk
  through as if you've never seen the project.

## Communication

- When I say "yes", "do it", or "push": execute. Don't repeat the plan.
- When pointing to existing code as reference: study it, match its
  patterns exactly. My working code is a better spec than my description.
- Work from raw error data. Don't guess. If a bug report has no output,
  ask for it.

## Bun

Default to using Bun instead of Node.js.

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` or `ts-node <file>`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`
- Use `bun build <file.html|file.ts|file.css>` instead of `webpack` or `esbuild`
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` or `pnpm run <script>`
- Bun automatically loads .env, so don't use dotenv.

## APIs

- `Bun.serve()` supports WebSockets, HTTPS, and routes. Don't use `express`.
- `bun:sqlite` for SQLite. Don't use `better-sqlite3`.
- `Bun.redis` for Redis. Don't use `ioredis`.
- `Bun.sql` for Postgres. Don't use `pg` or `postgres.js`.
- `WebSocket` is built-in. Don't use `ws`.
- Prefer `Bun.file` over `node:fs`'s readFile/writeFile
- Bun.$`ls` instead of execa.

## Testing

Use `bun test` to run tests.

```ts#index.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hello world", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

## Frontend

Use HTML imports with `Bun.serve()`. Don't use `vite`. HTML imports fully support React, CSS, Tailwind.

Server:

```ts#index.ts
import index from "./index.html"

Bun.serve({
  routes: {
    "/": index,
    "/api/users/:id": {
      GET: (req) => {
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ id: req.params.id }));
      },
    },
  },
  // optional websocket support
  websocket: {
    open: (ws) => {
      ws.send("Hello, world!");
    },
    message: (ws, message) => {
      ws.send(message);
    },
    close: (ws) => {
      // handle close
    }
  },
  development: {
    hmr: true,
    console: true,
  }
})
```

HTML files can import .tsx, .jsx or .js files directly and Bun's bundler will transpile & bundle automatically. `<link>` tags can point to stylesheets and Bun's CSS bundler will bundle.

```html#index.html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <script type="module" src="./frontend.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

With the following `frontend.tsx`:

```tsx#frontend.tsx
import React from "react";

// import .css files directly and it works
import './index.css';

import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.body);

export default function Frontend() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}

root.render(<Frontend />);
```

Then, run index.ts

```sh
bun --hot ./index.ts
```

For more information, read the Bun API docs in `node_modules/bun-types/docs/**.md`.
